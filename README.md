This is a 4th month anniversary gift for the loveliest girl in this world. I want her to know that this page will be updated frequently to let the world know her amazing existence. 
I am truly in awe of your existence, it makes me feel so nice and so amazing that you are the love of my life and that we could be spending forever together. I wish I could come to you and make it my life's mission to be the best person ever to you. I love you and I miss you more than anything and anyone in this world. 
You know 4 months have passed, and it feels like it has just been 4 days, we have had our ups and downs but all I know is that I want you more than the best and the worst days of my life and I want you to be a part of them forever. You are lovely, you are amazing and I really will take care of you and lobe you like none other. I will be there for you and I will always make sure you know the live and support is there for you forever Shovu Movu. This page is my dedication and immortalisation of you, forever in my heart and on the internet. ❤️
